# üõ°Ô∏è Agile-ISO27001-ISMS-Management for ISO 27001 Sustainment

## üöÄ Executive Summary: The Strategic Shift

Establishing an ISO 27001 ISMS is a solved problem, but **sustaining it is the real challenge**. Without a planned, continuous process, the system inevitably becomes an opaque, hard-to-track, and ultimately non-compliant structure.

This project outlines our proven methodology: applying **Agile Management (Scrum/Kanban)** to the ISO 27001 lifecycle. We transform annual, bureaucratic compliance into a **Controlled, Highly Visible Operational Rhythm**‚Äîour **Continuous Compliance Scrum (CCS)** system.

## üõë The Problem vs. The Agile Solution

The core of our approach addresses the operational failures of traditional compliance management, which suffered from task accumulation and over-reliance on individual competence.

| The Traditional Challenge | The Agile Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **‚ùå Accumulation & Opacity:** Large tasks rely on individuals' competency, leading to audit failures. | **‚úÖ "Divide and Conquer" Principle:** Tasks are broken into small, auditable **Task Cards (GitHub Issues)**, ensuring accountability is process-driven. |
| **‚ùå Inconsistency:** Compliance is a "cramming" effort before the audit, making the ISMS non-living. | **‚úÖ Monthly Sprint Cadence:** Work is pulled into **monthly cycles**, guaranteeing the ISMS is a **sustainable and living structure** maintained consistently throughout the year. |
| **‚ùå Low Visibility:** Management lacks real-time insight into delays and associated risks. | **‚úÖ Weekly Planning & Control:** **Weekly checkpoints** are established (replacing daily stand-ups) to focus on impediment removal, output verification, and risk-based decision-making. |
| **‚ùå Lack of Control:** Difficulty tracking whether every small control is actually executed. | **‚úÖ Auditable Output Control:** Every completed task generates a traceable, documented output, which is the **irrefutable evidence** for successful audits. |

## üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Implementation: Step-by-Step CCS Flow

The CCS methodology is fully executed by mapping the flow to **GitHub Issues** and **Projects**, ensuring control at every stage.

### Step 1: Establish the Strategy (The Master Plan)

This creates the **Product Backlog** and the strategic map, housed in the primary Project.

| Component | GitHub Area | CCS Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Master Backlog** | **GitHub Project (Table View)** | Houses the exhaustive list of all recurring ISO 27001 duties, serving as the central planning hub. |
| **Recurring Tasks** | **Issues** | Every recurring control is a standalone **Issue** (e.g., *Annual Management Review*). |
| **Custom Fields** | **Project Settings** | **`Risk Level`** and **`Control Owner`** are added to enable risk-based prioritization and separate execution from permanent control ownership. |

### Step 2: Implement the Agile Flow (The Monthly Execution)

This is the execution phase, simulating your team's **Monthly Sprint** using a Kanban board.

| Action | GitHub Area | Agile Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create Sprint** | **GitHub Project (Kanban View)** | A new board is created monthly (e.g., `2026 February Sprint`) to define the short-term commitment. |
| **"Divide & Conquer"** | **Issues/Task Lists** | Large **Master Backlog** Issues are broken down into granular steps and pulled into the Sprint board's **`To Do`** column. |
| **Workflow Columns** | **Kanban Board** | Defined columns (`To Do` ‚Üí `In Progress` ‚Üí `Review/Approval` ‚Üí `Done`) enforce the controlled flow and ensure no task skips the necessary **quality gate** (`Review/Approval`). |
| **Weekly Review** | **Issue Updates & Board Movement** | Team updates are tracked here. Tasks are moved across columns, ensuring impediments are tracked (using a **`Blocked`** Label) and outputs are verified weekly. |

### Step 3: Ensure Visibility and Auditability (The "Big Picture")

The controlled structure guarantees that management always has transparent, real-time insight into compliance health.

| Report Type | GitHub Area | CCS Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compliance Health** | **Project Charts** | Visualizes the workload distribution and the percentage of **`Delayed`** (Delayed) tasks, providing an instant risk status. |
| **Risk Focus** | **Table View Filtering** | Enables filtering the entire backlog by the **Risk Level: Critical** Custom Field, prioritizing security impact over simple deadlines. |
| **Audit Evidence** | **Closed Issues** | Every Issue moved to **`Done`** is closed with a final comment linking to the approved document, forming the **irrefutable audit trail**. |

## üîë Outcome: Sustainable and Controllable ISMS

By adopting the CCS methodology, the organization achieves a structure where accountability is process-driven, risk is proactively managed, and **ISO 27001 is made sustainable**‚Äîa crucial asset for any modern business.
